                <h3>Who am I?</h3> 
                <p class="card-content">
                  As I mentioned in the introductory video, I am a first-generation college student at the
                  University of Washington. I am currecntly studying Informatics with a focus on
                  HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)!
                </p>

                <h3>My Background:</h3>
                <p class="card-content">
                  I come from a small rural town in Cantral/Eastern Washington. Due to there not being many
                  resources to exlpore ones interest, I am able to make the most with what I'm given even when
                  given very little! Leaving my small hometown has allowed me to learn about my strengths as a minority
                  and a person of color.

              <h3>Why UX?</h3>
              <p class="card-content">
                Originally I thought I would be going into the mechanical engineering field, well... I was wrong.
                I genuinely enjoy working with not only people but with technology, helping with the process of using
                technology for the greater good. As a UX designer, I get the best of both worlds along with the aspect
                of beign able to be creative!
              </p>

              <h3>What I Aim To Do As A Designer:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Help break practices in place that overlook marginalzed users.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Be a compassionate + empathetic designer.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Work to perfect my craft by continously learning.
                    </li>
