I aimed to create a website that would help those who do not know about design, look into what it is and learn more about it.
I chose to create a website as I could tie in what I learned in my other classes this quarter (the coding aspect) and incorporate that woth what I learned from this class.
Other ideas I had for this project but had trouble figuring out was creating the key concepts interactive cards that changed from presenting the questions and asnwers sperately.
I had trouble narrowing down the topics I was going to shoose but focused on the few I felt were more applicable in my area of interest.
The themes I had chosen also refelct the themes I found the most interesting out of all of them.
