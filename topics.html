            <h3 id="concept">The Conept Of Design</h3>
            <h4>What is design?</h4>
            <p class="card-content">
              For me, design is the art of creating visuals that help serve as
              some sort of aid or support to digest information.
            </p>

            <h4>Why should we have a definition of design?</h4>
            <p class="card-content">
              As we are all our own person, an individual, we all have different views and
              view the world through our own lens. I believe that knowing what design means
              to you helps to benefit the impact your work will have and improve the quality.

            <h3 id="concept">The Conept Of Observation</h3>
              <h4>What is observation?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                For me, observation is the process of examning something to gain a better understanding of that "thing".
              </p>

              <h4>How is observation useful in design?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                When designing, it is critical to observe, obseriving the current flow or how the end result is
                being ineteracted with. Observation can be done in many different aspects looking at a design from
                the bigger picture or even observing the smaller aspects of something and discovering something new.

            <h3 id="concept">The Conept Of Constraints</h3>
              <h4>What are constraints?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                For me, a constraint can be defined as a form of limitation or restriction.
              </p>

              <h4>Are constraints useful in design?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                Constraints can be many different things and vary but can be used in a way where
                they help one when designing. Constraints can be used to change the way we look at
                a problem ranging from things such as the scope of the prototype or limit the mind 
                of prototype/product one can produce.

              <h3 id="concept">The Conept Of Questions</h3>
              <h4>What are questions?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                For me, a question is a sentenced formed in a way to gain information.
              </p>
  
              <h4>Why should we ask questions?</h4>
              <p class="card-content">
                The quality of questions can vary, but can all serve their own purpouse. Questions are key
                to gainging insight and help one gain a better understanding. They can go from asking yourself
                a thought provoking questions ot get ideas flowing or to gain a better idea of a design or what
                you are designing for.
